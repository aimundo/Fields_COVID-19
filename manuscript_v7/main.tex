\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a worldwide public health concern.
Although vaccines against this disease were rapidly developed,
vaccination uptake has not been equal across all the segments of the
population. In particular, it has been shown that there have been
differences in vaccine uptake across different segments of the
population. However, there are also differences in vaccination across
geographical areas, which might be important to consider in the
development of future public health vaccination policies. In this study,
we examined the relationship between vaccination status (having received
the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine), and different socio-economic and
geographical factors. Our results show that between October of 2021 and
January of 2022, individuals from underrepresented communities were
three times less likely to be vaccinated than White/Caucasian
individuals across the province of Ontario in Canada, and that in some
cases, within these groups, individuals in low-income brackets had
significantly higher odds of vaccination when compared to their peers in
high income brackets. Finally, we identified significantly lower odds of
vaccination in the Central, East and West Health Regions of Ontario
within certain underrepresented groups. This study shows that there is
an ongoing need to better understand and address differences in
vaccination uptake across diverse segments of the population of Ontario
that the pandemic has largely impacted.

\section{Background}\label{background}}

As of May of 2023, there have been 765 million confirmed cases of
COVID-19 around the world, including 6.8 million
deaths\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-WHO-Covid}{1}}. Although
this disease is no longer categorized as a global health emergency by
the World Health Organization
(WHO)\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rigby2023}{2}}, there is
ongoing concern due to continued transmission, the possibility of surges
in cases and deaths due to new virus
variants\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-un2023}{3}}, and ongoing
issues in health systems around the world that could be exploited by a
novel virus or another public health emergency in the
future\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-mackey2021}{4}}.

In particular, the pandemic showed multiple challenges with regard to
vaccination. The rapid development of vaccines against COVID-19
initially brought the hope of a rapid end to the pandemic as vaccination
campaigns in certain parts of the world started as early as December of
2020\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-thelancet2021}{5}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-tanne2020}{8}}.
Although it has been estimated that so far COVID-19 vaccines have been
able to prevent millions of deaths
worldwide\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-watson2022}{9}}, their
implementation has faced multiple challenges across the world. These
challenges included the rapid emergence of new virus
variants\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-li2021}{10}}, the waning
of vaccine
protection\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-dolgin2021}{11}},
inequality in vaccine access between high-income and low-income
countries\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-gerretsen2021}{12},\protect\hyperlink{ref-tamey2022}{13}},
vaccine
hesitancy\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-nafilyan2021}{14}}, and
differences in vaccine uptake across the
population\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-willis2021}{15},\protect\hyperlink{ref-skirrow2022}{16}}.
More specifically, it is well established that lower vaccination uptake
has been observed in individuals within certain underrepresented groups
(e.g., Black, Asian, or Indigenous) as well as individuals with
socio-economic
disadvantages\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-willis2021}{15}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-hussain2022}{21}}.

Reasons given for this inequality in vaccination uptake have included
medical mistrust due to systemic medical
racism\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-stoler2021}{17},\protect\hyperlink{ref-mosby2021}{22}},
mistrust in
vaccines\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-willis2021}{15}}, and
the existence of health misinformation and
disinformation\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-mosby2021}{22}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-freeman2020}{24}}.
However, it is important to consider that vaccination uptake can also
vary geographically across the administrative or political subdivisions
within a country. For example, differences in COVID-19 vaccination rates
have been associated with differences in attitudes towards vaccination
in administrative areas in New York and
Chicago\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-malik2020}{25}}, scarcity
of vaccination facilities in areas where underrepresented groups reside
in Toronto\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-bogoch2022}{7}}, as
well as an absence of prioritization of areas inhabited by vulnerable
groups in the southeastern region of the
US\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-nguyen2021}{26}}. Other
studies have also shown heterogeneity in vaccine uptake within counties
in the
US\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-mollalo2021}{27}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-bhuiyan2022}{30}},
indicating that accounting for geographical differences in vaccination
can help predict patterns of booster uptake in Scottish
communities\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-wood2022}{31}}.
Therefore, the study of vaccination uptake across administrative of
political areas can be useful to highlight differences that governments
or public health agencies might need to address. However, in the case of
Canada, there is a limited amount of studies that have analyzed
geographical differences in vaccination. Existing studies in this area
have focused on differences within certain cities, such as
Toronto\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-choi2021}{32}}, or
Montréal\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-mckinnon2021}{33}}), or
have explored differences between
provinces-at-large\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-guay2022}{19}},
but to our knowledge, there are no studies that analyze differences in
vaccination uptake at the intra-provincial level. Such need is specially
important in the context of Canada's pandemic response goals, which have
been to minimize serious illness and deaths while minimizing societal
disruption\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-naci2023}{34}}.
Analyzing differences in vaccination uptake within the provinces can aid
to identify inequalities that might exist and that need to be addressed
before the advent of another pandemic.

This need is especially important in the case of Ontario, the most
populated province of Canada, and which as has a complex healthcare
system. Between 2007 and 2019, Ontario managed healthcare access to its
inhabitants using 14 intra-provincial divisions called the Local Health
Integration Networks (LHINs), which aimed to provide an integrated
health system. However, this approach was complex, bureaucratic,
resulting in excessive expenditures, disparities in mortality rates, the
deterioration of certain performance indicators (such as wait times and
hospital readmissions), fragmented electronic health systems, and
inequities in health services
access\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-tsasis2012}{35}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-lysyk2016}{39}}.
With the intent of better organizing and delivering care, in late 2019
the provincial government eliminated the LHINs and incorporated the
areas covered by them into six larger Health Regions (North East, North
West, Central, Toronto, West, and East), which are managed by a new
government agency, Ontario Health
(OH)\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-dong2022}{37}}.

On the other hand, public health in Ontario is administered by Public
Health Ontario (PHO), a government agency established in late 2007 and
that is currently composed of 34 Public Health Units (PHUs) that cover
the entire geography of the province. Although PHUs were commissioned
with leading the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine within their
respective
areas\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rotenberg2021}{40}}, the
vaccine rollout occurred with significant interaction between PHO and
OH; in many instances both agencies had to work together to organize
vaccination clinics, with personnel associated with OH also being
actively involved when demand exceeded the capacity of PHO personnel,
especially in rural
areas\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-ashcroft2023}{41}}. Indeed,
based on the experience of COVID-19, there are ongoing discussions on
how OH and PHO will interact in the future, and the challenges that this
will entail for the healthcare system of the
province\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-dion2022}{42}}.

Therefore, considering the relatively recent adoption of the Health
Region model and its alignment with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic,
there is an ongoing need to analyze the existence of geographical
disparities in vaccination uptake within the Health Regions and identify
the socio-demographic groups that might be affected, as this can serve
as an indirect assessment of the state of the implementation of the new
model while helping identify ongoing challenges that decision-makers
might need to address to ensure the long-term success of this model and
its interaction with PHO, which is specially important considering that
previous research has highlighted disparities in the level of activity
of each Health
Region\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-sethuram2023}{43}}.

Therefore, in this study we wanted to understand if there were
differences in COVID-19 vaccination rates among the Health Regions
between October 2021 and January of 2022. To contextualize these
differences, we included socio-economic factors in our analysis aiming
to identify which demographic groups were particularly impacted, in
order to provide an assessment of the current state of healthcare access
in Ontario.

\subsection{Data and Methods}\label{sec-data}}

We used data from the \emph{Survey of COVID-19 related Behaviours and
Attitudes}, a repeated cross-sectional survey focused on the Canadian
province of Ontario that was commissioned by the Fields Institute for
Research in Mathematical Sciences and the Mathematical Modelling of
COVID-19 Task Force under ethical guidance from the University of
Toronto (under Research Ethics Board approval \#40999), and which ran
between September 30th, 2021 and January 17th, 2022.

Briefly, the survey was deployed using Random Domain Intercept
Technology (RDIT), a methodology for internet surveys developed by the
company commissioned to run the survey (RIWI Corp., Toronto, Canada),
and that has been used in the area of public health research to examine
trends in vaccination
rates\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-sargent2022}{44}}, ratings
of care quality\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-kim2021}{45}},
and perceptions of vaccine
efficacy\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-seeman2010}{46}}. In the
case of the survey used for this study, internet users whose device
meta-data indicated their presence in the province of Ontario had a
random chance of being redirected to the survey after they had clicked
on a registered but commercially inactive web link, or after they had
typed in a web address for a site that was dormant but that was
temporarily managed by RIWI. Users then decided whether to anonymously
participate in the survey, and those that participated were able to exit
the survey at any time. After the survey closed, regardless if it was
complete or incomplete, access was denied to any further users with the
same internet protocol address (IP), effectively allowing each user only
one opportunity to participate in the survey. Users who indicated they
were under the age of 16 were exited from the survey without creating a
record. Finally, the personal identifier information from each user that
participated in the survey was automatically scrubbed and replaced by a
unique ID.

Survey users entered their socio-economic information (age, income, and
racial/ethnic group), and were asked information on vaccination status
by using the question ``Have you received the first dose of the COVID
vaccine?'', with possible answers ``yes'' and ``no''
(Table~\ref{tbl-descriptive-stats}). Of notice, the racial/ethnic and
socio-economic categories from the survey did not match exactly the
categories from the 2016 Census (e.g., the categories ``East
Asian/Pacific Islander'' as well as the income bracket ``over CAD
110,000'' do not exist in the Census data). Therefore, we used a
combination of sources to re-group certain categories and socio-economic
strata in order to obtain estimates from the Census that could be used
to correct the data. Further details can be found in the Appendix.

Additionally, the survey automatically collected the geographical
location of the respondent (using the nearest municipality, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-map}), and the date of access to the survey. The
original dataset contained 39,029 observations. However, the number of
complete observations was much lower than the total number of
observations due to the survey design, which allowed respondents to exit
at any time and deployed the questions randomly. We selected the
observations with complete answers (6,343 observations, or 16.25\% of
the total) for our analysis. It should be noted that this response rate
is similar to response rates observed in previous studies that have used
the same type of survey instrument, with response rates between 15\% and
22\%\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-kim2021}{45},\protect\hyperlink{ref-seeman2010}{46}}.
Next, we matched the city of each observation with its corresponding
LHIN and Health Region, and removed observations from areas with low
representation (254 observations corresponding to the North West and
North East Health Regions). After all the preliminary analyses, the
total number of observations used for analysis was 6,236 and included
the East, Central, Toronto, and West Health Regions covering between
October 1st, 2021 and January 17, 2022. The original dataset, clean
dataset, and details on the data cleaning process, and data preparation
are described in detail in the
\href{https://github.com/aimundo/Fields_COVID-19/}{GitHub repository}
for this paper.

are color-coded and labelled sequentially. Internal boundaries within
certain Health Regions indicate areas previously covered by the Local
Integrated Health Networks (LHINs).}

\end{figure}

To analyze the survey data, we used a logistic regression model to
examine the impact of the Health Regions in the uptake of the first dose
of the vaccine, using as the variable of interest the question ``Have
you received the first dose of the COVID vaccine?'' (with possible
answers ``yes'' or ``no''), while considering as independent variables
the socio-economic factors of the participants, months covered by the
survey (Table~\ref{tbl-descriptive-stats}), and the Health Regions of
OH. Furthermore, we included certain interactions (Race and Health
Region and Race and income) in our model as previous studies have shown
that socio-economic factors and their interactions are significant
predictors of intent of vaccination and vaccination
status\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-nguyen2022}{47}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-cnat2022a}{49}}.

Because we identified differences between the percentage of
participation within the socio-demographic factors of the survey
considered in in our analysis and the percentage within these factors in
the 2016 Census (such as participation within age groups and
racial/ethnic groups), we used an iterative proportional fitting
procedure
(\emph{raking})\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-deming1940}{50}}
to correct the percentages within each socio-demographic variable using
population totals obtained from the Census and OH; later, we fitted the
regression model to the uncorrected and corrected data to determine if
there were any differences in the obtanied estimates. Details regarding
the correction can be found in the Appendix. All analyses were conducted
in R 4.2.2 using the packages
\texttt{survey}\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-lumley2011}{51}},\texttt{tidyverse}\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-wickham2019}{52}},

\subsection{Sample Characteristics}\label{sample-characteristics}}

Table~\ref{tbl-descriptive-stats} shows the characteristics of the data
from the Fields COVID-19 survey used for analysis. The sample contained
6,236 observations, from which 24.8\% (1,547) corresponded to
individuals that reported not having initiated a COVID-19 vaccine
primary series (in other words, not having received the first dose of
the vaccine). The rate for the first dose of the vaccine ranged between
71-79\% across all household income brackets, age groups, Health
Regions, and the months considered in the survey. However, the highest
rate for the uptake of the first dose of the vaccine were reported by
individuals in the highest income bracket (79\%), those between 16 and
34 years of age (77\%), individuals that lived in the East Health Region
(77\%), and during January of 2022 (78\%). Between racial/ethnic groups,
White/Caucasian individuals reported the highest uptake of the first
dose of the vaccine (84\%), against values that ranged between 63 and
66\% in the case of Arab/Middle Eastern, Black, Indigenous, Latin
American individuals, and those that belonged to the ``other'' racial
group category (which included Southeast Asian, Filipino, West Asian,
and minorities not identified elsewhere percentages ).

lower odds of vaccination were identified in both cases in individuals
characterized by a low household income, or that identified as part of
underrepresented groups. However, the magnitude of the estimates
differed between the uncorrected and corrected models and more
importantly, there were differences in the statistical significance of
certain estimates before and after the correction. Specifically, the
uncorrected model showed significant differences in vaccination odds
between the age groups considered, the East Health Region, Latin
American individuals with a household income under CAD 25,000, and
Indigenous individuals living in the Central Health Region
(Figure~\ref{fig-models},B) but these were deemed non statistically
significant after the correction.

However, significantly lower odds of vaccination were identified in the
corrected model for those with a household income under CAD 25,000
(OR=0.37, CI={[}0.27,0.51{]}) and those with an income between CAD
25,000 and 59,999 (OR=0.58, CI={[}0.42,0.81{]}). Additionally,
individuals who identified as Arab/Middle Eastern, Black, Latin
American, of mixed background, or that belonged to other racial groups
(a category that included Southeast Asian, Filipino, West Asian, and
minorities not identified elsewhere), had significantly lower odds of
vaccination than those in the White/Caucasian group (ORs and CIs=0.28
{[}0.16,0.51{]}, 0.27 {[}0.16,0.45{]}, 0.40 {[}0.21,0.76{]}, 0.53
{[}0.30,0.92{]}, 0.23 {[}0.15,0.36{]}). Additionally, individuals that
reported living in the Central and West Health Regions had higher odds
of vaccination than those in the Health Region of Toronto (ORs and
CIs=1.61 {[}1.10,2.34{]}, and 1.59 {[}1.16,2.19{]}, respectively).

Interestingly, individuals in underrepresented groups with a household
income below CAD 25,000 had higher odds of vaccination (when compared to
those with a household income above CAD 60,000). This held true in the
case of Arab/Middle Eastern individuals (OR=34, CI={[}1.70,6.79{]}),
Black individuals (OR=3.81, CI={[}2.05, 7.09{]}), and those in other
racial or ethnic groups (OR=3.19, CI={[}2.00,5.09{]}). Additionally,
individuals with an income between CAD 25,000 and 59,999 in the
Arab/Middle Eastern and other racial or ethnic groups also had higher
odds of vaccination than their high-income peers (ORs and CIs=6.96
{[}2.67,18.16{]}, and 3.5 {[}1.85,6.62{]}).

Finally, the place of habitation affected the odds of vaccination for
certain underrepresented groups, as significantly lower odds of
vaccination were identified for the interaction between Health Region
and race in the case of Black individuals in the Central Health Region
(OR=0.39, CI={[}0.2,0.75{]}), Arab/Middle Eastern individuals in the
East Health Region (OR=0.41 {[}0.17, 0.98{]}), and in the Indigenous and
mixed groups in the West Health Region (ORs and CIs={[}0.31 {[}0.14,
0.7{]} and 0.38 {[}0.19, 0.76{]}, respectively).

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

In this study, we wanted to understand if there were differences in
COVID-19 vaccination rates among the Health Regions between October 2021
and January of 2022 while identifying the socio-demographic determinants
(and their interactions) that could help predict these differences.
Using the Health Regions as the base of our analysis was advantageous,
as these newly implemented administrative areas match closely the
geographical boundaries of the Health Regions that have been
historically used to group Public Health Units in the
province\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-bolotin2018}{56},\protect\hyperlink{ref-ohesi}{57}}.
Thus, a Health Region-based analysis could provide information on
vaccination uptake that could be useful to understand patterns within
the realm of PHO and OH. Moreover, such analysis could provide an
overall assessment of intra-provincial disparities that might need to be
addressed moving forward by decision-makers in order to ensure that in
the event of a future public health emergency or pandemic, OH and PHO
will able to work collaboratively in an efficient way having learned
from the COVID-19
experience\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-ashcroft2023}{41}},
thus ensuring that the population of the province benefits in the long
term from a robust health system.

Our results show that indeed, there were differences in the uptake of
the first dose of the vaccine across Ontario in certain
socio-demographic groups. Specifically, those who identified as
Arab/Middle Eastern, Black, Latin American, having mixed racial or
ethnic background, or that belonged to other groups not explicitly
included in the survey (Southeast Asian, Filipino, West Asian, and
minority groups not identified elsewhere) had vaccination odds that were
between a third and a half of that of individuals that identified as
White or Caucasian (Figure~\ref{fig-models}). These results are
consistent with previous studies that have shown lower vaccination rates
in individuals with the same socio-demographic
characteristics\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-guay2022}{19}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-hussain2022}{21},\protect\hyperlink{ref-carter2022}{58}}.

Lower vaccine uptake in the socio-demographic groups indicated above may
be influenced in part, by vaccine hesitancy and refusal, which have been
associated in underrepresented Canadian individuals with concerns on
vaccine safety, effectiveness, and experiences of racial discrimination
in health
settings\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-cnat2022a}{49},\protect\hyperlink{ref-basta2022}{59}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-cnat2023}{61}}.
However, it has been shown that structural barriers also play an
important role in vaccination uptake. In the case of underrepresented
individuals, such barriers include complex scheduling systems, language
barriers, lack of adequate public transportation, and lack of accessible
vaccination
sites\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-njoku2021}{62}}. In this
regard, it is interesting to note that vaccination venues were scarce in
low socio-economic areas that had the highest burden of COVID-19 in
Toronto and other regions of Ontario around the time covered by the
survey\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-bogoch2022}{7},\protect\hyperlink{ref-iveniuk2021}{63}},
and that pharmacies in the Peel region (an area identified as a
``hotspot'' with high numbers of essential workers and multigenerational
households) could not keep up with vaccine
demand\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-gill2022}{64}}. This
suggests that the observed differences are associated with disparities
in vaccine access that were present during the period covered by the
survey.

Interestingly, whereas overall self-reported vaccination rates were
found to be statistically significantly lower in various
underrepresented groups when compared to White/Caucasian individuals,
the change in odds of vaccination within certain racial groups and
income strata was actually positive, in contrast to the White/Caucasian
group, where vaccination odds decreased in income brackets below CAD
60,000 (Supplementary Figure A-5). Specifically, individuals in low
income brackets that belonged to Arab/Middle Eastern, Black, or other
minority groups had higher odds of vaccination that their peers with an
income above 60,000 CAD.

This result likely reflects in part the fact that individuals in
underrepresented groups tend to perform occupations that have been
deemed as ``essential'' in the context of the
pandemic\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-hawkins2020}{65},\protect\hyperlink{ref-ct2021}{66}},
which include workers in the areas of grocery stores, gas stations,
warehouses, distribution, and manufacturing, all being occupations for
which an income within the significant brackets identified in the
analysis is to be expected. From one side, individuals in essential
occupations in the province experienced higher rates of morbidity and
mortality during the first year of the
pandemic\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rao2021}{67}}, but later
on, they had priority for COVID-19
vaccination\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-mishra2021}{68}}.
Additionally, it is known that vaccination uptake in these individuals
was encouraged by vaccination staff in certain parts of the
province\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-gill2022}{64}}. These
facts, combined with evidence of increased trends in vaccination in this
group
elsewhere\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-nguyen2021b}{69}},
suggest that in Ontario, the type of occupation of individuals in
underrepresented groups (which might have also affected their decision
to get a vaccine based on their knowledge of increased risk), played an
important role in the higher the odds of vaccination observed in these
individuals.

However, the results also indicate that the place of habitation affected
the odds of vaccination for certain underrepresented groups (interaction
term of Health Region and Race, Figure~\ref{fig-models},B).
Specifically, this held true in the case of individuals identifying as
Indigenous or with mixed racial background in the West Health Region,
Black individuals in the Central Health Region, and Arab/Middle Eastern
individuals in the East Health Region Figure~\ref{fig-models}. For these
individuals, vaccination odds were lower when compared to the Toronto
Health Region (Supplementary Figure A-6). We indicate next some
contributing factors that might help provide context to these results.

First, in this case it is useful to analyze the data considering the
LHINs in each Health Region, because most studies in the literature
focused on Ontario use the LHINs as the base of their analyses. The West
Health Region covers the area previously occupied by the Hamilton
Niagara Haldimand Brant, South West, and Waterloo Wellington LHINs,
whereas the East Health Region covers the area of the former Champlain
and Central East LHINs. Previous research has identified health
disparities in these (mostly rural) regions, such as unequal
distribution of primary care providers, increased mortality, and low
pharmacist
availability\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-shah2019}{70}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-timony2022}{72}}.

Furthermore, there is an ongoing challenge for the health system of the
province with regard to personalized healthcare for marginalized
individuals. For example, the West Health Region has only two Aboriginal
Health Access Centres (community-led primary healthcare organizations
focused on First Nations, Métis, and Inuit communities) to provide care
to an estimated population of 100,000 Indigenous individuals living in
the area\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-ontariohealth}{73}}.
Lack of access to personalized healthcare affects individuals that may
mistrust the traditional healthcare system due to systemic racism or
oppression, which is known to be the case for Indigenous and Black
individuals in Canada, as these rationales have been associated with
observed lower vaccination rates among these
groups\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-smylie2022}{74},\protect\hyperlink{ref-eissa2021}{75}}.
Taken together, this suggests that healthcare disparities specific to
these underrepresented groups in certain parts of the province impacted
vaccination uptake, and highlights the need of investments in the Health
Regions focused on resources, infrastructure, and specially personnel
that can deliver personalized care to marginalized communities, as it
has been shown that such efforts have improved trust in vaccination in
underrepresented groups
elsewhere\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-schafferderoo2020}{76}}.

There are some limitations to the present study. First, the data
collection design, which allowed respondents to withdraw from the survey
at any point, and that deployed the questions in a random manner
resulted in an elevated number of missing observations without a
definite pattern and complicated the implementation of sensitivity
analyses. Therefore, we focused on entries that had complete answers,
and corrected the data using population-wide information from the
Census. However, more granular corrections would be needed to obtain
more accurate estimates: For example, our analysis identified higher
odds of vaccination in the Central and West Health Regions, but in this
case these differences are likely to be driven by the proportion of
White/Caucasian individuals, who had higher vaccination rates than other
racial groups. Correcting for each racial/ethnic group in each Health
Region would provide a more accurate estimation of region-wide
vaccination rates but unfortunately, presently this correction cannot be
implemented as such stratification has not been implemented in the open
data that can be obtained from the Census.

Additionally, our analysis did not consider the North West and North
East Health Regions, due to the low number of entries from these areas
in the survey (Figure~\ref{fig-map}). Low representation is expected as
these regions as they only account for 5\% of the total population of
Ontario. However, these areas have the highest proportion of Indigenous
inhabitants\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-ontariohealth}{73}}.
In the context of personalized care, there is a need to collect data
that focuses on these Health Regions where additional health disparities
might be present and possibly understudied.

The results in this study are based on self-reported data, where bias
might be present. However, in the context of COVID-19, it has been shown
that good agreement exists between self-reported and documented
vaccination
status\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-stephenson2022}{77}}, we
believe that our data was able to provide a valid sample of vaccination
uptake in the province. This is supported by the statistically
significant higher vaccination odds that were identified for January of
2022 in the model, which are consistent with province-wide trends
reported by Public Health Ontario (which show a 4\% increase between
early December and January, in contrast to a 2.5\% increase between
October and
November\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-ontario-covid}{78}});
however, the short time window constitutes essentially a ``snapshot''
view of the evolution of the disease, and additional data would be
needed to obtain estimates per racial/ethnic group over time across all
Health Regions that can help inform the existence of other health
disparities.

Nonetheless, the results presented here can serve as a starting point to
motivate the collection of robust longitudinal data that can be used to
quantify geographical and temporal differences within vulnerable
segments of the population, and that can be used to inform the
development of adequate public health policies within the province of
Ontario or across other provinces in Canada that aim to minimize
disparities in health access.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

The evidence collected in this study shows that differences in the
uptake of the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by underrepresented
individuals in the province of Ontario were the result of complex
relationships between infrastructure, resources, occupations, geography,
and socio-economic factors. Specifically, we identified that between the
last trimester of 2021 and January of 2022 individuals that identified
as Arab or Middle Eastern, Black, Latin American, of a mixed background,
or that belonged to other racial groups had significantly lower odds of
vaccination when compared to White/Caucasian individuals in Ontario.

However, although overall vaccination uptake was lower in these
underrepresented individuals in the province as a whole, the odds of
vaccination differed within certain income levels and Health Regions in
these groups, specially for those that reported a low household income
and that had higher vaccination odds that individuals in the same
racial/ethnic group with a higher income. These results highlight the
complex landscape of the province, where varying degrees of rurality
exist in conjunction with a socio-demographic makeup that is unique to
each of the Health Regions.

Such complexity presents an ongoing challenge for the healthcare system
of Ontario, and in particular, to the Health Region model which will
need to adapt and build on the LHIN model with the aim of providing an
integrative approach that can serve those that are most vulnerable
across all the Health Regions of the province. In particular,
personalized care is an area that could be further developed to improve
vaccination uptake in underrepresented individuals in the future. As we
have shown above, there are currently a limited number of centers
focused on community-led healthcare in the province, and our results
showed the existence of differences in vaccination uptake between
certain Health Regions. Improving personalized care for underrepresented
individuals then, can serve as a point to improve trust and facilitate
vaccine access in these marginalized communities.

Furthermore, in the event of a future pandemic or public health
emergency in the province in the years ahead, PHO and OH will need to
collaborate on the implementation of public health measures (such as
vaccination campaigns) building on the experience gained during the
COVID-19 vaccination rollout. So far, the COVID-19 pandemic served as a
stress test for both agencies, showing the necessity from decision
makers to clearly define how PHO and OH will interact in the future in
order to ensure that Ontarians can benefit by virtue of a robust
collaboration between both agencies.

Finally, the recent nature in the adaption of the Health Region poses a
challenge for researchers in the acquisition of data and information
that can be used to analyze the performance of the new model. From one
side, the Health Regions have not been incorporated as part of Census
data (LHINs were considered before in the Census), and this impacts the
amount of data that can be obtained. On the other hand, evaluations of
the Health Region model are at the moment not considered in the Annual
Reports of the Auditor General of Ontario, which was critical in the
past to identify limitations in the LHIN model. Currently, the only
demographic information available for each Health Region is provided by
Ontario Health (the agency that administers the Health Regions) but this
information only provides general estimates that do not allow for
detailed analyses of performance indicators (such as hospitalizations,
readmissions, and trends in chronic disease incidence) between the
Regions. Therefore, there is a pressing need for open data that can be
used by researchers and decision-makers to assess the performance of the
Health Region model.
