# Discussion

In this study, we hypothesized that differences in COVID-19 vaccination uptake were present between the Health Regions between late 2021 and early 2022. Our goal was to determine which socio-demographic groups could be impacted by these disparities in order to provide decision-makers with information that could be used to develop policies focused on reducing or eliminating these differences and ensuring that the Health Region model is able to fulfill its mission of improving health access for all Ontarians.

Our results show that indeed, there were differences in vaccination odds across Ontario in certain socio-demographic groups. Specifically, those who identified as Arab/Middle Eastern, Black, Latin American, having mixed racial or ethnic background, or that belonged to other groups not explicitly included in the survey (Southeast Asian, Filipino, West Asian, and minority groups not identified elsewhere) had vaccination odds that were between a third and a half of that of individuals that identified as White or Caucasian (@fig-models). These results are consistent with previous studies that have shown lower vaccination rates in individuals with the same socio-demographic characteristics [@guay2022;@muhajarine2021;@carter2022;@hussain2022]. 

Lower vaccine uptake in the socio-demographic groups indicated above may be influenced in part, by vaccine hesitancy and refusal, which have been associated in underrepresented Canadian individuals with concerns on vaccine safety, effectiveness, and experiences of racial discrimination in health settings [@basta2022;@cnat2022a;@cnat2022b;@cnat2023]. However, it has been shown that structural barriers also play an important role in vaccination uptake. In the case of underrepresented individuals, such barriers include complex scheduling systems, language barriers, lack of adequate public transportation, and lack of accessible vaccination sites [@njoku2021]. In this regard, it is interesting to note that vaccination venues were scarce in low socio-economic areas that had the highest burden of COVID-19 in Toronto and other regions of Ontario around the time covered by the survey [@bogoch2022;@iveniuk2021], and that pharmacies in the Peel region (an area identified as a "hotspot" with high numbers of essential workers and multigenerational households) could not keep up with vaccine demand [@gill2022]. This suggests that the observed differences are associated with disparities in vaccine access that were present during the period covered by the survey.

Interestingly, whereas overall self-reported vaccination rates were found to be statistically significantly lower in various underrepresented groups when compared to White/Caucasian individuals, the change in odds of vaccination within certain racial groups and income strata was actually positive, in contrast to the White/Caucasian group, where vaccination odds decreased in income brackets below CAD 60,000 (Supplementary Figure A-5). Specifically, individuals in low income brackets that belonged to Arab/Middle Eastern, Black, or other minority groups had higher odds of vaccination that their peers with an income above 60,000 CAD.

This result is likely reflects in part the fact that individuals in underrepresented groups tend to perform occupations that have been deemed as "essential" in the context of the pandemic [@hawkins2020;@ct2021], which include workers in the areas of grocery stores, gas stations, warehouses, distribution, and manufacturing, all being occupations for which an income within the significant brackets identified in the analysis is to be expected. In Ontario, these workers had priority for COVID-19 vaccination [@mishra2021]; and there is evidence of interventions by vaccination staff in certain parts of the province to encourage vaccination uptake by these individuals [@gill2022]. These facts, combined with evidence of increased trends in vaccination in this group elsewhere [@nguyen2021b], suggest that the type of occupation of individuals in underrepresented groups played an important role in increasing the odds of vaccination.

However, the results also indicate that the place of habitation affected the odds of vaccination for certain underrepresented groups (interaction term of Health Region and Race, @fig-models,B). Specifically, this held true in the case of individuals identifying as Indigenous or with mixed racial background in the West Health Region, Black individuals in the Central Health Region, and Arab/Middle Eastern individuals in the East Health Region [@fig-models]. For these individuals, vaccination odds were lower when compared to the Toronto Health Region (Supplementary Figure A-6). We indicate next some contributing factors that might help provide context to these results.

First, in this case it is useful to analyze the data considering the LHINs in each Health Region, because most studies in the literature focused on Ontario use the LHINs as the base of their analyses. The West Health Region covers the area previously occupied by the Hamilton Niagara Haldimand Brant, South West, and Waterloo Wellington LHINs, whereas the East Health Region covers the area of the former Champlain and Central East LHINs. Previous research has identified health disparities in these (mostly rural) regions, such as unequal distribution of primary care providers, increased mortality, and low pharmacist availability [@shah2019;@crighton2015;@timony2022].

Furthermore, there is an ongoing challenge for the health system of the province with regard to personalized healthcare for marginalized individuals. For example, the West Health Region has only two Aboriginal Health Access Centres (community-led primary healthcare organizations focused on First Nations, MÃ©tis, and Inuit communities) to provide care to an estimated 100,000 Indigenous individuals living in the area [@ontariohealth]. Lack of access to personalized healthcare affects individuals that may mistrust the traditional healthcare system due to systemic racism or oppression, which is known to be the case for Indigenous and Black individuals in Canada, as these rationales have been associated with observed lower vaccination rates among these groups [@smylie2022;@eissa2021]. Taken together, this suggests that healthcare disparities specific to these underrepresented groups in certain parts of the province impacted vaccination uptake, and highlights the need of investments in the Health Regions focused on resources, infrastructure, and specially personnel that can deliver personalized care to marginalized communities, as it has been shown that such efforts have improved trust in vaccination in underrepresented groups elsewhere [@schafferderoo2020].

There are some limitations to the present study. First, the data collection design, which allowed respondents to withdraw from the survey at any point, and that deployed the questions in a random manner resulted in an elevated number of missing observations without a definite pattern and complicated the implementation of sensitivity analyses. Therefore, we focused on entries that had complete answers, and corrected the data using population-wide information from the Census. More granular corrections would be needed to obtain more accurate estimates. For example, our analysis identified higher odds of vaccination in the Central and West Health Regions, but in this case these differences are likely to be driven by the proportion of White/Caucasian individuals, who had higher vaccination rates than other racial groups. Correcting for each racial/ethnic group in each Health Region can provide a more accurate estimation of region-wide vaccination rates but unfortunately, at the moment this correction cannot be implemented as such stratification is has not been implemented in the Census.

Additionally, our analysis did not consider the North West and North East Health Regions, due to the low number of entries from these areas in the survey (@fig-map). Low representation is expected as these regions as they only account for 5\% of the total population of Ontario. However, these areas have the highest proportion of Indigenous inhabitants [@ontariohealth]. In the context of personalized care, there is a need to collect data that focuses on these Health Regions where additional health disparities might be present and possibly understudied.

The results in this study are based on self-reported data, where bias might be present. However, in the context of COVID-19, it has been shown that good agreement exists between self-reported and documented vaccination status [@stephenson2022], we believe that our data was able to provide a valid sample of vaccination uptake in the province. This is supported by the statistically significant higher vaccination odds that were identified for January of 2022 in the model, which are consistent with province-wide trends reported by Public Health Ontario (which show a 4\% increase between early December and January, in contrast to a 2.5\% increase between October and November [@ontario-covid]); however, the short time window constitutes essentially a "snapshot" view of the evolution of the disease, and additional data would be needed to obtain estimates per racial/ethnic group over time across all Health Regions that can help inform the existence of other health disparities. 

Nonetheless, the results presented here can serve as a starting point to motivate the collection of robust longitudinal data that can be used to quantify geographical and temporal differences within vulnerable segments of the population, and that can be used to inform the development of adequate public health policies within the province of Ontario or across other provinces in Canada that aim to minimize disparities in health access.
