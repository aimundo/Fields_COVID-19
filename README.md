# Repository for the analysis of the Fields_COVID-19 data

How this repository is organized:

I have created multiple folders so the complete project is here (from the data analysis, to the manuscript writing, etc). Below are the directories that are currently in this repository and what you can find in each one:

- code:  this folder is currently empty but in the future it will contain R scripts for data cleaning and statistical analyses that will be incorporated in the manuscript.

- data: This folder contains the original data files. The files in this directory are:
    - FieldsBehaviouralSurveyRawDataV2V3.xlsx: This is the original file that I found in the dropbox link that I was provided, it contains the dataset (Sheet 1), a data dictorionary, and some preliminary analyses that Fields ran regarding demographic differences between the dataset and the Ontario Census.
    - Fields_data.csv: This is a file I created, it is essentially the survey data from the file above converted to csv format to import it in R.
